# Expression parser

This App can parse your mathematical expressions and evaluate them

The next operations are supported:

- "+"
- "-"
- "*"
- "/"
- "pow (e.g. 2^10 = 1024)"
- "log"
- "unary -"
- "min"
- "max"
- leading zeroes
- trailing zeroes

You can also use this to evaluate function in some point. 
The number of variables are not limited.

Example:

"2x - 5y + 10z"
(1, 1, 1) -> 2 * 1 - 5 * 1 + 10 * 1 = 7
